<h3>About</h3>
<p align="justify">This is a web techonology based project offered by <a href="https://cs.aiub.edu/">Depertment of Computer Science</a>. In this course, we got to know about XAMPP control panel and used it as a local server for running our php code. We have learned how to implement html code into .php extaintioned file. We learned css, json, javascript, ajax, jquery, php and mysql. We also learned about Layered architecture. OOP conceped is used to implement. In this project we developed an online based Banking Management System using above mentioned learnings.</p>

<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p align="justify">Banking or financial sites are revolutionizing the banking sector in Bangladesh. Banking sites are used to conduct a range of financial transactions through the financial institution’s website. It connects the core banking system operated by a bank to provide customers access to banking services in place of traditional branch banking. We are doing this project to be a part of this revolution and earn first-hand experience in the web technologies related to banking which is an integral part of software engineering. Thorough this, in dept idea regarding backend and the front end can be achieved. Furthermore, we can get knowledge about how to build a secure web application that is user-friendly in every aspect. Here Our project is the starting path of a well- organized project on Web Technologies. In this project, we tried to ensure an overall better user experience. We also tried to implement all the general banking features in the project. As a reference, we took City Bank as our ideal web page. It is a well-designed website that has everything a user commands whenever needed. It has all the needed information and operations organized. It gives a premium user experience and ensures all the services to users online. Besides we also take help from <a href ="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> is an online free learning platform.</p>

<h3>Project Folder Structure</h3>
<p align="justify">We followed the layered architecture technique to attain the perfect structure for the folders used in our project. The idea behind Layered Architecture is that modules or components with similar functionalities are organized into horizontal layers. As a result, each layer performs a specific role within the application. Our project folder structure is described below. We used control for storing PHP control files of the project, CSS folder for storing .css files, data for JSON, image for storing images that are used in the project, JavaScript for storing .js files, Model for the database queries, uploads for the uploaded files through the form. And lastly view for containing all the HTML files of the project.</p>
